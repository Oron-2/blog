                <h2>Notes on building a forum with <abbr title="PHP Bulletin Board">phpBB</abbr></h2>
                <p class="date">25/12/21</p>

                <p>I want to get familiarised with the process of using software, the primary purpose of which is to
                    help make forums. Also, another main reason is that I like this type of "old" style forums more than
                    social networks like Facebook, Twitter and so on, because, more or less, these sorts of platforms
                    allow anyone to peek and enter your personal space. Also, in order to use them effectively, you need
                    to add a large amount of private information. The good thing about the forums is that it is a place
                    for communication between registered users without focusing on someone's personal information, but
                    instead on the topic under discussion. Therefore, the driving force behind users who visit this type
                    of forum is not about finding out about someone but about a genuine interest in a subject.</p>

                <p>My search for software that helps create a forum showed me that most platforms work with PHP. In
                    principle, I did not intend to embark on another technology because only JavaScript is difficult
                    enough to keep me busy, but there seems to be no other choice. The good thing is that most things
                    seem to be done through a UI panel, and I won't have to write PHP code. At least that's what it
                    looks like at first glance.</p>

                <p>The most popular, developed, and free platforms I have chosen are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://mybb.com/">https://mybb.com/</a></li>
                    <p>“<abbr title="My Bulletin Board">MyBB</abbr> is the free and open source forum software powering
                        thousands of engaging, vibrant, and
                        unique communities across the internet.”</p>
                    <li><a href="https://www.phpbb.com/">https://www.phpbb.com/</a></li>
                    <p>“<abbr title="PHP Bulletin Board">phpBB</abbr> is a free flat-forum bulletin board software
                        solution that can be used to stay in touch
                        with a group of people or can power your entire website. With an extensive database of
                        user-created extensions and styles database containing hundreds of style and image packages to
                        customise your board, you can create a very unique forum in minutes.”</p>
                    <li><a href="https://flarum.org/">https://flarum.org/</a></li>
                    <p>"Forums made simple. Modern, fast, and free!</p>
                    <li><a href="https://www.simplemachines.org/">https://www.simplemachines.org/</a></li>
                    <p><abbr title="Simple Machines Forum">SMF</abbr> is all that in one package, giving you an easy to
                        use forum with many powerful features for
                        you as well as your users. <abbr title="Simple Machines Forum">SMF</abbr> is an open-source
                        project made by volunteers from across the
                        world.</p>
                </ul>

                <p>After reading several articles and topics on the Internet about these technologies, I decided to
                    focus on <abbr title="PHP Bulletin Board">phpBB</abbr>.
                </p>

                <p>A few things to take in mind when developing the forum are:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Installing a Bulgarian translation pack</li>
                    <li>Choosing and integrating phpBB theme</li>
                    <li>Checking helpful extensions</li>
                    <li>Take a note on all categories that should be present</li>
                    <li>Create a home page</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Now the hard part is actually doing it.</p>
