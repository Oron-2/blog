                <h2>Accessing directories or files with spaces in the name</h2>
                <p class="date">27/12/21</p>
                
                <p>I ran into a small problem after I started using the terminal a bit. I tried to change my current
                    working directory
                    to another, which, however, contained spaces in its name with no success. So, I had to find a way to
                    navigate to that folder because I knew it was not the only one on my computer having spaces. I
                    searched for a solution on the internet, reached to a friend and ended up with three ways to do
                    that:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Using TAB</li>
                    <p>Using the TAB autocompletes the folder's full name by adding a backslash, also called an escape
                        character for each whitespace between words which makes zsh read the space as part of the file
                        name.</p>
                    <p>If I have a folder with the name &quot;My folder&quot;, the command to navigate to it will look
                        like this:</p>
                    <p>cd My\ folder</p>
                    <li>Using double quotes</li>
                    <p>Writing down the path's name being either relative or absolute in double quotes works too. There
                        is no need to add an escape character for the spaces when using double quotes:</p>
                    <p>&quot;cd My folder&quot;</p>
                </ul>
                <p>It's a little thing, but it was an obstacle for me to continue what I was trying to do.</p>
