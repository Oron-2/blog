        <p>According to captain Niobi in the new movie “Matrix: Resurrections”:</p>

        <p>1017</p>
        <p>01:11:06,553 --> 01:11:09,890</p>
        <p>Every night I would dream</p>
        <p>of attack sirens.</p>

        <p>1018</p>
        <p>01:11:10,557 --> 01:11:11,808</p>
        <p>But then,</p>

        <p>1019</p>
        <p>01:11:14,394 --> 01:11:16,605</p>
        <p>I would wake up to this...</p>

        <p>1020</p>
        <p>01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:22,069</p>
        <p>silence.</p>

        <p>1021</p>
        <p>01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:27,074</p>
        <p>I'm ashamed of it now.</p>

        <p>1022</p>
        <p>01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:31,161</p>
        <p>My pessimism of how long</p>
        <p>it took me to believe</p>

        <p>1023</p>
        <p>01:11:31,244 --> 01:11:34,498</p>
        <p><b>a world without war
            was possible.</b></p>

        <p>
          But is it? Is this nothing but another utopia? Like the utopia of a world without evil? Who says what is evil
          and what is good? I know… many questions and not many answers. But one thing is for sure. For there to be
          good,
          there must be evil. How else will we be able to distinguish between the two? Even if something considered evil
          by some is considered good by others and vice versa, it means that both exist and are part of the universe.
          For one reason or another, there will always be wars, and they will be the field where good and evil meet,
          intertwine and fight.
