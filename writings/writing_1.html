      <h2>“…a world without war was possible”</h2>

        According to captain Niobi in the new movie “Matrix: Resurrections”:

        1017
        01:11:06,553 --> 01:11:09,890
        Every night I would dream
        of attack sirens.

        1018
        01:11:10,557 --> 01:11:11,808
        But then,

        1019
        01:11:14,394 --> 01:11:16,605
        I would wake up to this...

        1020
        01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:22,069
        silence.

        1021
        01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:27,074
        I'm ashamed of it now.

        1022
        01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:31,161
        My pessimism of how long
        it took me to believe

        1023
        01:11:31,244 --> 01:11:34,498
        <b>a world without war
          was possible.</b>

        But is it? Is this nothing but another utopia? Like the utopia of a world without evil? Who says what is evil
        and what is good? I know… many questions and not many answers. But one thing is for sure. For there to be good,
        there must be evil. How else will we be able to distinguish between the two? Even if something considered evil
        by some is considered good by others and vice versa, it means that both exist and are part of the universe.
        For one reason or another, there will always be wars, and they will be the field where good and evil meet,
        intertwine and fight.
